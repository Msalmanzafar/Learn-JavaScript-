                An <strong>alert</strong> is a box that pops up to give the user a message. Here's code for an alert that
                displays the message "Thanks for your input!"
            </p>
            <p class="code" ><b>alert("Thanks for Chosen");</b></p>

               <p class="alert1">
                  A <strong>variable</strong> is created when you write var (for variable) followed by the name that you
                  choose to give it. It takes on a particular value when you assign the value to it. This is a
                  JavaScript statement that creates the variable name and assigns the value <b>"Mark"</b> to it.
                 </p>
                 <p class="code" ><b>var name = "Mark";<br/> alert(" Thank you " + name);</b></p>

             <h2 class="alert1-heading">Variables for Numbers</h2>
              <p class="alert1">
                A string isn't the only thing you can assign to a variable. You can also assign a number.</p>
                <p class="code" ><b>var weight = 150;</b></p>
              <p class="alert1">
                  If you enclose a number in quotation marks, it's a string. JavaScript can't do addition on it.
                    It can do addition only on numbers not enclosed in quotes.
                    Now look at this code.
              </p>
            <p class="code" ><b>var originalNum = 23; <br/>var newNum = originalNum + 7;</b></p>

             <h2 class="alert1-heading">Variable Names Legal and Illegal</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list">A variable name can't contain any spaces.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords.
                        For example, <i>userAlert</i> and <i>myVar</i> are legal.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">Capital letters are fine, but be careful. Variable names are case sensitive. A <i>rose</i> is not a
                        <i>Rose</i>. If you assign the string "Floribundas" to the variable <i>rose</i>, and then ask JavaScript
                        for the value assigned to <i>Rose</i>, you'll come up empty.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">I teach the <i>camelCase</i> naming convention. Why <q>camelCase</q>? Because there is a hump or
                        two (or three) in the middle if the name is formed by more than one word. A camelCase
                        name begins in lower case. If there's more than one word in the name, each subsequent
                        word gets an initial cap, creating a hump. If you form a variable name with only one
                        word, like <i>response</i>, there's no hump. It's a camel that's out of food. Please adopt the
                        camelCase convention. It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less
                        likely to get variable names mixed up.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">Make your variable names descriptive, so it's easier to figure out what your code means
                        when you or someone else comes back to it three weeks or a year from now. Generally,
                        <i>userName</i> is better than <i>x</i>, and <i>faveBreed</i> is better than <i>favBrd</i>, though the shorter names
                        are perfectly legal. You do have to balance readability with conciseness, though.
                        <i>bestSupportingActressInADramaOrComedy</i> is a model of clarity, but may be too much
                        for most of us to type or read. I'd shorten it.</li>

                The arithmetic operators I've been using, +, -, *, and /, are undoubtedly familiar to you.

            <p class="code" ><b>var whatsLeftOver = 10 % 3; <br/></b></p>
               <p class="alert1"> % is the modulus operator. It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by
                    another. It gives you the remainder when the division is executed. </p>
