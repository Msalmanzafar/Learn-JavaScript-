                An <strong>alert</strong> is a box that pops up to give the user a message. Here's code for an alert that
                displays the message "Thanks for your input!"

               <p class="alert1">
                  A <strong>variable</strong> is created when you write var (for variable) followed by the name that you
                  choose to give it. It takes on a particular value when you assign the value to it. This is a
                  JavaScript statement that creates the variable name and assigns the value <b>"Mark"</b> to it.
                 </p>
                 <p class="code" ><b>var name = "Mark";<br/> alert(" Thank you " + name);</b></p>

              <p class="alert1">
                A string isn't the only thing you can assign to a variable. You can also assign a number.</p>
                <p class="code" ><b>var weight = 150;</b></p>
              <p class="alert1">
                  If you enclose a number in quotation marks, it's a string. JavaScript can't do addition on it.
                    It can do addition only on numbers not enclosed in quotes.
                    Now look at this code.
              </p>
            <p class="code" ><b>var originalNum = 23; <br/>var newNum = originalNum + 7;</b></p>

             <h2 class="alert1-heading">Variable Names Legal and Illegal</h2>
                <ul class="alert1">
                    <li class="list">A variable name can't contain any spaces.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords.
                        For example, <i>userAlert</i> and <i>myVar</i> are legal.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">Capital letters are fine, but be careful. Variable names are case sensitive. A <i>rose</i> is not a
                        <i>Rose</i>. If you assign the string "Floribundas" to the variable <i>rose</i>, and then ask JavaScript
                        for the value assigned to <i>Rose</i>, you'll come up empty.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">I teach the <i>camelCase</i> naming convention. Why <q>camelCase</q>? Because there is a hump or
                        two (or three) in the middle if the name is formed by more than one word. A camelCase
                        name begins in lower case. If there's more than one word in the name, each subsequent
                        word gets an initial cap, creating a hump. If you form a variable name with only one
                        word, like <i>response</i>, there's no hump. It's a camel that's out of food. Please adopt the
                        camelCase convention. It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less
                        likely to get variable names mixed up.</li><br/>
                    <li class="list">Make your variable names descriptive, so it's easier to figure out what your code means
                        when you or someone else comes back to it three weeks or a year from now. Generally,
                        <i>userName</i> is better than <i>x</i>, and <i>faveBreed</i> is better than <i>favBrd</i>, though the shorter names
                        are perfectly legal. You do have to balance readability with conciseness, though.
                        <i>bestSupportingActressInADramaOrComedy</i> is a model of clarity, but may be too much
                        for most of us to type or read. I'd shorten it.</li>

              <p class="alert1">
                The arithmetic operators I've been using, +, -, *, and /, are undoubtedly familiar to you.
                This one may not be:
              </p>
            <p class="code" ><b>var whatsLeftOver = 10 % 3; <br/></b></p>
               <p class="alert1"> % is the modulus operator. It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by
                    another. It gives you the remainder when the division is executed. </p>
            <p class="code" ><b>
                var whatsLeftOver = 10 / 3;<br/>
                var whatsLeftOver = 10 * 3;<br/>
                var whatsLeftOver = 10 + 3;<br/>
                var whatsLeftOver = 10 - 3;

             <h2 class="alert1-heading">Math expressions<br/> Unfamiliar operators</h2>
             <p class="alert1">
                There are several specialized math expressions you need to know. Here's the first one.
                <p class="code" ><b>num++;<br/></b></p>
                <p class="alert1">This is a short way of writing...</p>
                    <p class="code" ><b>num = num + 1;<br/></b></p>
              </p>
                <p class="code" >
                    <b>1 var num = 1;</b><br/>
                    <b> 2 var newNum = num++;</b><br/>
                </p>
                <p class="alert1"> 
                In the example above, the original value of <i>num</i> is assigned to <i>newNum</i>, and <i>num</i> is
                incremented afterward. If <i>num</i> is originally assigned 1 in the first statement, the second
                statement boosts its value to 2. <i>newNum</i> gets the original value of <i>num</i>, 1.</p>
                <p class="code" >
                    <b>1 var num = 1;</b><br/>
                    <b>2 var newNum = ++num;</b><br/>
                </p>
                <p class="alert1"> 
                In the statements above, both num and newNum wind up with a value of 2.
                If you put the minuses after the variable, the new variable is assigned the original value,
                and the first variable is decremented.</p>
                <p class="code" >
                    <b>1 var num = 1;</b><br/>
                    <b>2 var newNum = num--;</b><br/>
                </p>
                <p class="alert1"> 
                <i>num</i> is decremented to 0, and <i>newNum</i> gets the original value of <i>num</i>, 1.
                But if you put the minuses before the variable, <i>newNum</i> is assigned the decremented, not
                the original, value. Both <i>num</i> and <i>newNum</i> wind up with a value of 0.</p>
                <p class="code" >
                    <b>1 var num = 1;</b><br/>
                    <b>2 var newNum = --num;</b><br/>
                </p>

            <h2 class="alert1-heading">Math expressions<br/> Eliminating ambiguity</h2>
            <p class="code" ><b>var totalCost = 1 + 3 * 4;</b><br/></p>
            <p class="alert1"> The value of <strong>totalCost</strong> varies, depending on the order in which you do the arithmetic. If
            you begin by adding 1 + 3, then multiply the sum by 4, <strong>totalCost</strong> has the value of 16. But if
            you go the other way and start by multiplying 3 by 4, then add 1 to the product, you get 13.
            In JavaScript as in algebra, the ambiguity is cleared up by precedence rules. As in
            algebra, the rule that applies here is that multiplication operations are completed before
            addition operations. So <strong>totalCost</strong> has the value of 13.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="alert1">
                When you use parens to make your intentions clear to JavaScript, it also makes your code
                easier to grasp, both for other coders and for you when you're trying to understand your own
                code a year down the road. In this statement, the parentheses tell JavaScript to first multiply 3
                by 4, then add 1. The result: 13.</p>
                <p class="code" ><b>var totalCost = 1 + (3 * 4);</b><br/></p>
                <p class="alert1">
                If I move the parentheses, the arithmetic is done in a different order. In this next statement,
                the placement of the parens tells JavaScript to first add 1 and 3, then multiply by 4. The result
                is 16.</p>
                <p class="code" ><b>var totalCost = (1 + 3) * 4;</b></p>

                you wanted to personalize a message. In another part of your code you've
                asked the user for her name and assigned the name that she entered to a variable, userName.
                (You don't know how to do this yet. You'll learn how in a subsequent chapter.)<br/>
                Now, you want to combine her name with a standard "Thanks" to produce an alert that
                says, for example, "Thanks, Susan!"<br/>
                When the user provided her name, we assigned it to the variable userName. This is the
